occasional return visits to the acefonts.com web site.  If you have
a web site, setting up a link to Ace Fonts at the above URL would 
also be nice.

This font may be freely redistributed under the following conditions:

1. Send an e-mail to tell me about it.

2. This text file must stay with the .ttf file.

3. If you make it available at a Web archive, include a link to

4. If you include it in a collection distributed on CD, floppy disk, 
   or any other comparable medium, send me a copy of the CD or floppy 
   disk or whatever.

5. Keep in mind that nothing I write in this file means I'm giving up 
   the copyright for this font.
