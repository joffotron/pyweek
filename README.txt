Welcome to The Extraterrorestrial, Happy Cake Industries entry in the third
session of the bi-yearly PyWeek competition.

The theme for PyWeek 3 was ``the disappearing act''.

This software is released under the ISC license.  The ISC license is
functionally equivalent to a two-term BSD license, but with the language
removed that is made unnecessary by the Berne convention.

This software uses PyGame (1.7.1) and Numeric (24.2) and includes and uses
portions of Phil's pyGame Utilities (0.10.5), Euclid (0.1), and Unauthorized
Type's ``Another'' TrueType font.

See AUTHORS for a list of the people who have contributed to this project.  The
initial idea was devised by Marcel.  Joff created the sound effects and music.
Dale, Elizabeth, and Marcel drew and painted the graphics.  Marcel and Matthew
wrote the code.

To run the game on Windows, double click on ``tet.exe'' in the current
directory.  To run the game on any other platform, execute ``tet.py'' in the
current directory.
