Welcome to The Extraterrorestrial, Happy Cake Industries entry in the third

The theme for PyWeek 3 was "the disappearing act".

This software is released under the ISC license.  The ISC license is
functionally equivalent to a two-term BSD license, but with the language
removed that is made unnecessary by the Berne convention.

This software uses PyGame (1.7.1) and includes and uses portions of Phil's
pyGame Utilities (0.10.5) and Euclid (0.1).
